# Neural networks and deep learning workshop
October 11 · 6:00 PM
Container Solutions
Workshop on neural networks, hosted by container solutions.

The pipeline factory presents two meetups around the theme of neural networks and deep learning: a workshop and a hack night. 

Producing breakthrough after breakthrough, deep learning is rapidly transforming the field of artificial intelligence. Quoting MIT technology review: 

"Deep learning: with massive amounts of computational power, machines can now recognize objects and translate speech in real time. Artificial intelligence is finally getting smart." [1] 



Program

• Introduction neural networks

• Introduction deep learning

• Workshop neural networks with Keras

Please notice there is no dinner (or a sponsor may show up.)

Workshop

Up to a few years ago, the use of neural network was reserved for a select group of experts. Times are changing. Today, there are several deep learning frameworks available that provide easily accessible interfaces to the latest developments in deep learning. Moreover, these frameworks enable  non-specialist to create and train basic neural networks with only a few lines of code. 

During this workshop, we use the framework Keras to create basic neural networks that perform tasks like image classification. 




Preparation

•  Basic programming knowledge

•  If possible, bring your laptop

• If possible, install docker at home

• Download docker image (see https://github.com/sjoerddehaan/keras-tutorials) 

• Willingness to help and teach other members, as we are going to work in groups. 

Don't worry if you don't have a laptop with docker; we will work with one laptop per group.

Hack night coming up

Stay tuned, withing a few weeks after the workshop, we organize a hack night with the same theme "Neural networks and deep learning"
