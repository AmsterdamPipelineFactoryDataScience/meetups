The factory

During each meetup, we work on a new project, related to data science. We start with some high level description of the system that we are going to build, we form groups and we start building. Everyone can learn and contribute at his or her own level. Your contribution need not to be technical. If you love writing, you can write a blog post. If you are totally  confused, you are in an ideal position to make sure that the comments and the documentation of your group's project are in order. And if you want to practice presenting, you can pitch your teams solution. 


Pipelines and data science 

A pipeline consists of a number of building blocks (pipes), that form a working system. 

Turning your data science project into a pipeline can be a huge advantage. The pipeline offers a clear high level overview on the project, since you start with a working system. That means collaborators do not need to understand all details of a project, in order to contribute.  In the Factory, we bring together people with different backgrounds and different skills, to let them collaborate on small data science projects. 


Containers 

How can we make sure that everyone in the factory can learn and enjoy?  And how can we remove hurdles for those that have less of a technical background? During our meetups, we strive to create a working systems as quickly as possible. Seeing the actual thing working in front of your eyes, may be the best explanation you can get. As we will see during the meetup, containers and virtual machines speed-up the process of developing and sharing working systems. 


What background do I need?

All you need is curiosity for data science and excitement for working together.  Although we are going to use Linux, experience with Linux is not needed. We work in diverse groups of three. 

In terms of skills... it would be nice if we have some people who like to contribute their soft skills: presenting, blogging, design, creativity. Linux, programming and web development are also in demand, as we need at least one experienced person in each group.
